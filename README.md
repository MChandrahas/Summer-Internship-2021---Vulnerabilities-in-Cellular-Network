# Summer-Internship-2021---Vulnerabilities-in-Cellular-Network


During this research we have researched about the loopholes in network like 3G, 4G & 5G, ways to stop these attacks and have gathered a lot of resources and made an android app. So that the people who installed the app can go through the resources that we have collected and understand the loopholes, different types of attacks and how to detect the IMSI Catchers. This app is only for education purpose which contain multiple resources. We are planning to further develop this app, so that we can show the real-life demo of how an IMSI catcher work.

After referring to many research papers, articles and surveys done my many other researchers, I have come to a conclusion that there are some loopholes which cannot be corrected by the user side but can be corrected by the telecommunication authority with some effort. There are a lot of ways to identify fake cell tower (IMSI Catcher) but there are not any useful ways to avoid them. During this research we have made an android app for the education purpose about these IMSI Catchers. We are planning to further develop this app, so that we can show the real-life demo of how an IMSI catcher work.
